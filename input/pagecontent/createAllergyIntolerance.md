####  Create AllergyIntolerance processing steps:

1. A FHIR Client sends a POST request to the MWS *AllergyIntolerance* endpoint with  a payload containing the MwsAllergyIntolerance resource to be created, excluding ids
2. The request is validated - ALT: Validation failure. Operation Outcome resource returned
3. The AllergyIntolerance is created in the MWS database and an ID is assigned
4. A newly created  MwsAllergyIntolerance, including its ID,  is returned to the client


####  Create AllergyIntolerance Request Examples

##### Recorder CPN is known

This is an example of a create request in which the recorder's CPN is known:
[create AllergyIntolerance request](AllergyIntolerance-MwsAllergyIntolerance.json.html)

The recorder is provided as a relative literal reference to an HPIPractitioner 

```
 "practitioner": {
        "reference": "Practitioner/99ZZZS"
      }
```

##### Recorder CPN is not known

This is an example of a create request in which the recorder's CPN is not known:
[create AllergyIntolerance request - unknown CPN](AllergyIntolerance-MwsAllergyIntolerance-3.json.html)
The recorder is given as a logical reference using the local identifier and namespace

```
 "practitioner": {
        "identifier": {
          "value": "my-local-practionerid-1234",
          "system": "http://my-local-practioner-namespace.co.nz"
        }
