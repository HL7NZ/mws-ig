### About

The Medical Warnings System (MWS) is a registry designed to provide a single source of truth for patient medical warnings.
There are a number of different types of medical warnings held in MWS, currently only [AllergyIntolerance](StructureDefinition-MwsAllergyIntolerance.html) warnings are available in the MWS FHIR API described in this guide.

#### History
The MWS has historically been integrated into PAS systems using HL7 v2, and   SOAP integration is also available.

#### Future
Five more FHIR resources will be introduced to allow the complete set of medical warnings held in MWS to be accessible by the MWS FHIR APIs.
